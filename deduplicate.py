"""
This code demonstrates how to use dedupe with a comma separated values
(CSV) file. All operations are performed in memory, so will run very
quickly on datasets up to ~10,000 rows.

We start with a CSV file containing our messy data. In this example,
it is listings of early childhood education centers in Chicago
compiled from several different sources.

The output will be a CSV with our clustered results.

For larger datasets, see our [mysql_example](mysql_example.html)

# ## Logging

# Dedupe uses Python logging to show or suppress verbose output. This
# code block lets you change the level of loggin on the command
# line. You don't need it if you don't want that. To enable verbose
# logging, run `python examples/csv_example/csv_example.py -v`
